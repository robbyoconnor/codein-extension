(not using Chrome, see [#not-using-chrome](https://github.com/robertpainsi/codein-extension#not-using-chrome))

This plugin will highlight Google Code-In tasks which needs attention at https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/in-progress/.

![Example image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertpainsi/codein-extension/master/example.png)

It will change the tasks

* ![#e53935](https://placehold.it/15/e53935/000000?text=+) Color to red if
  * The Student is waiting for more than 12 hours for a review.
  * The Student asked a question.
* ![#9ccc00](https://placehold.it/15/9ccc00/000000?text=+) Color to green if
  * The last activity was by a Mentor and therefore the task is handled. Beware, sometimes this will give you a false-positive if the Mentor commented that he/she can't help. The Mentor should always seek for help on Slack, IRC, Google Groups then.
* ![#2894ed](https://placehold.it/15/2894ed/000000?text=+) Color to blue if
  * The Student is running out of time (less than 6 hours) and the clock is still ticking.
* ![#ffcca4](https://placehold.it/15/ffcca4/000000?text=+) Transparency to 50% if
  * There is no comment on the claimed task yet.
  * The task has been approved and the Student is still waiting for parental consent.

Tasks waiting for a review will have the default color ![#ff8f00](https://placehold.it/15/ff8f00/000000?text=+)
